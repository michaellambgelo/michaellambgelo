### Hi there 👋

### My name is Michael Lamb

I am a software engineer at C Spire but I also lead both an internal developer meetup and an employee-organized gaming club. Outside of C Spire, I co-organize a Jackson-based developer meetup and a film club. A lot of my GitHub repositories are forks of projects I found interesting to read about and try to understand. Reading code is so important, but sometimes it feels like all people want to do is write it and get it over with. I believe literacy (in any subject) is an attitude and a choice that an individual must self-determine in order to succeed in communication with other people. 

In addition to pontificating about computer science education and pedagogy, you'll find me working on projects for my personal web domain michaellamb.dev where I try to do new things that I'm not being asked to do anywhere else.

You should get to know me if you're reading this, I'd guess.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I am a Mississippi transplant; I graduated high school and moved to the state to attend a college which shut down. I then achieved a degree in Software Engineering at Mississippi State University and have stayed since.
