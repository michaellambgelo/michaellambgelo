### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Michael Lamb

I am a software engineer at C Spire but I also lead both an internal developer meetup and an employee-organized gaming club. The meetup is called C Spire I/O and the gaming club is C Spire Gaming. Outside of C Spire, I co-organize a Jackson-based developer meetup (JAWAD) and a film club (Jackson Film Club). 

A lot of my GitHub repositories are forks of projects I find interesting to read and to understand. Reading code is so important, but sometimes it feels like all people want to do is write it and get it over with. I believe literacy (in any subject) is an attitude and a choice that an individual must self-determine in order to succeed in communication with other people. I try to practice reading code comprehension through exposure to various projects, problem spaces, and repositories.

In addition to pontificating about computer science education and pedagogy, you'll find me working on projects for my personal web domain michaellamb.dev where I try to do new things that I'm not being asked to do anywhere else.

You should get to know me if you're reading this, I'd guess.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: I am a Mississippi transplant; I graduated high school and moved to the state to attend a college which shut down. I then achieved a degree in Software Engineering at Mississippi State University and have stayed since.
